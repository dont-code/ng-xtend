# XtStore

Based on [@ngrx/signals](https://ngrx.io/guide/signals), this libraries provides state management, automatic sort / filtering, and grouping with calculation on xt-typed data.
It provides independence from the source, together with already developed backends (local IndexedDB, Generic rest services)

It is used by the [ng-xtend framework](https://github.com/dont-code/ng-xtend/blob/main/README.md)
